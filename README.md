# Stellar Stream Orbit Integrators

Project completed in semester 1 of year 3 of Physics course at University of Surrey (September - November 2023).

## Overview

The aim of this project is to understand different orbit integrators and how their behavior in phase space reveals a more accurate orbit of stellar streams. It does not use real data but instead runs a simulation with basic starting parameters such as position and velocity (3D). Different integrators are then trialed to see how well they conserve energy and accurately represent stellar stream orbits. Euler and Kick-Drift-Kick are the main integrators being investigated. For more details, refer to the report document for a write-up of the findings.

## Note

This code was one of my first 'long-term' projects and may not be the most efficient as it was results-driven and not intensive on run-time. While it may not fully represent my current coding abilities, it was certainly an enjoyable and informative project.
